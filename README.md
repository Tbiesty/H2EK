# Halo 2 Anniversary Rebalanced

This repository contains the files for the [Halo 2 Anniversary Rebalanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/halothemasterchiefcollection/mods/368) mod.

The `main` branch contains the original files from the MCC Halo 2 Mod Tools (except for files excluded via `.gitignore` since they made the repo too big). Those excluded files are available in the MCC Halo 2 Mod Tools, which you can download from Steam.

The `halo_2a_rebalanced` branch contains the changed files used in the mod.

To build the mod, use the MCC Halo 2 Mod Tools from Steam. It is highly recommended to use [Osoyoos](https://github.com/num0005/Osoyoos-Launcher) to simplify the process of lauching the various tools that are within the MCC Halo 2 Mod Tools.
